TicTacToe

# Explanation

This exam is designed to test your knowledge in C# with a simple game of Tic Tac Toe and to test your eligibility for the XR Foundations Bootcamp (make sure you’ve carefully [read the curriculum](https://docsend.com/view/5nhpcnp) before applying). [Please submit your test result and codebase in the application to the Bootcamp.](https://xrbootcamp.com/application-form/)

Implemented here is a version of it. Inputs and visuals are already handled by the system, so you don’t have to worry about them.

**Your objective** is to implement a computer player that is smarter than the provided example. It should read the board and adapt to the player’s movements. Actively blocking them from winning instantly, and winning more than 50% of the games.

Some of the additional features you’ll have to check for are:

- Come up with a way to represent the Tic tac toe in code
- Make sure turns are passed between the AI and the player
- Make sure no piece can be put on top of another piece
- Check for a win-lose or tie condition

**It is completely okay to fail this test.** 

If you happen to find that any of the concepts used in the system are too complex or you’re not familiar with them, we do recommend going through the **[Free C# coding course](https://academy.xrbootcamp.com/courses/coding-with-unity)** since they are explained in detail there.
